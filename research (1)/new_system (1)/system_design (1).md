### Cryptographic Approach

Our system will use a hybrid approach combining the strengths of different cryptographic primitives:

1. **Key Management**
   - Use post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for key exchange
   - Implement secure key derivation functions
   - Support for hardware security modules (optional)
   - Automatic key rotation

2. **Data Encryption**
   - AES-256-GCM for bulk data encryption
   - ChaCha20-Poly1305 as an alternative for software-only environments
   - Authenticated encryption for all operations
   - Unique IV/nonce generation for each encryption operation

3. **Digital Signatures**
   - SPHINCS+ or similar post-quantum signature scheme
   - Hybrid approach with classical signatures during transition
   - Timestamp integration for non-repudiation

4. **Integrity Protection**
   - HMAC-SHA-256 for message authentication
   - Merkle trees for efficient verification of large files
   - Tamper-evident logging

### PDF-Specific Features

1. **Selective Encryption**
   - Ability to encrypt specific parts of PDF documents
   - Metadata preservation options
   - Support for encrypted annotations

2. **Format Preservation**
   - Maintain PDF structure and functionality
   - Preserve digital signatures already in the document
   - Support for encrypted forms

3. **Access Control**
   - Multiple recipient support
   - Permission levels (view, edit, print)
   - Time-based access restrictions

## Security Considerations

1. **Side-Channel Protection**
   - Constant-time implementations of all cryptographic operations
   - Memory access patterns independent of secret data
   - Resistance to cache-timing attacks

2. **Implementation Security**
   - Secure coding practices
   - Memory management (zeroing sensitive data)
   - Input validation
   - Error handling without information leakage

3. **Quantum Resistance**
   - Hybrid classical/post-quantum approach
   - Modular design to allow algorithm replacement
   - Conservative parameter selection

4. **Key Protection**
   - Secure key storage
   - Key derivation from passwords using Argon2
   - Key backup and recovery mechanisms

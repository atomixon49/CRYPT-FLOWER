# Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

## Overview
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. These algorithms are typically faster than asymmetric algorithms but require secure key exchange.

## Common Algorithms

### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Key Sizes**: 128, 192, or 256 bits
- **Block Size**: 128 bits
- **Structure**: Substitution-permutation network
- **Strengths**: 
  - Fast in both software and hardware
  - Well-analyzed and considered secure
  - Resistant to known attacks
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Implementation vulnerabilities (side-channel attacks)
  - Key management challenges
  - Potential vulnerabilities in specific modes of operation

### DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- **Key Size**: 56 bits
- **Block Size**: 64 bits
- **Structure**: Feistel network
- **Strengths**:
  - Well-analyzed
  - Simple design
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Short key length (easily brute-forced)
  - Considered obsolete for security applications

### 3DES (Triple DES)
- **Key Size**: 168 bits (effective security of 112 bits)
- **Block Size**: 64 bits
- **Structure**: Apply DES three times
- **Strengths**:
  - More secure than DES
  - Backward compatible with DES
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Slow compared to modern algorithms
  - Block size too small for modern applications

### ChaCha20
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Nonce**: 96 bits
- **Structure**: ARX (Add-Rotate-XOR) stream cipher
- **Strengths**:
  - Fast in software
  - No known practical attacks
  - Good resistance to timing attacks
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Relatively new compared to AES
  - Requires proper nonce management

## Mode of Operation Considerations

### ECB (Electronic Codebook)
- Encrypts each block independently
- **Major weakness**: Patterns in plaintext visible in ciphertext

### CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- Each block XORed with previous ciphertext block
- **Strengths**: Hides patterns
- **Weaknesses**: Sequential processing, padding oracle attacks

### GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- Combines counter mode with authentication
- **Strengths**: Parallelizable, provides authentication
- **Weaknesses**: Complex implementation, nonce reuse catastrophic

## Current Best Practices
- Use AES-256 in GCM mode for most applications
- Use ChaCha20-Poly1305 for software-only implementations
- Never reuse key-IV pairs
- Implement proper key management
- Use authenticated encryption

## Further Research Needed
- Quantum resistance of symmetric algorithms
- Side-channel attack mitigations
- Performance optimizations for specific use cases
